# Exploring-67-years-of-Lego
My first ever Data Analysis project - looking at Lego data. This was a project from DataCamp, which I am sharing on Github like a proud little Data Scientist!

For some reason (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3278) the beautiful images are not loading when you click on the Notebook as it's hosted here on GitHub, but the data and the code is all there. Rest assured it looks beautiful on my local Jupyter instance :-)
